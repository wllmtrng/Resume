* Management Responsibilities
    - Leading Risk Analytics team in designing and building out API to allow physicians to automatically get a list of probable diagnoses for a given patient, given past billing history and clinical notes, by providing a queryable **GraphQL** interface to serve dataset generated through periodically running jobs on **AWS EMR** [**Apache Spark**, **Node.js, PostgreSQL**].
    - Strategize with product management to prioritize product roadmap, juggling between maintaining existing product line and guiding direct reports to build pilot applications for the purpose of exploring new market segments.
    - Interview candidates for junior and senior software engineer positions and hire based on growth potential, technical ability, and cultural fit.
* Technical Duties and Accomplishments
    - Build HIPAA compliant multi-tenanted RESTful web services under the **Spring Framework** to assist health insurance plans improve their risk adjustment performance by providing data to indicate gaps in documentation and inferring probable patient medical conditions. Used for KPI dashboards, maps, graphs, and reports. **[Java, JDBC, MySQL, Scala, Apache Spark, Kafka, S3, EMR, CloudFormation]**
    - As individual contributor, spearheaded effort and educated stakeholders to transition existing data aggregation and batch processing pipeline under **Java, JDBC, and MySQL** to a more performant, scalable, and distributed approach with
    **Scala** and **Apache Spark** to decrease costs and address business need of generating larger reports under a shorter amount of time.
    - Exposed team to a developmental workflow using **Jupyter Notebook** to rapidly prototype out the existing batch processing pipeline to serve as a proof of concept, showing potential to scale as well as having 56x performance gains for 100 gigabyte scale datasets.
    - Took initial ownership of involvement to integrate Risk Analytics platform with new event infrastructure to consume real time events using **Apache Kafka** infrastructure recently rolled out by infrastructure team.
    - Built module for utilizing Kafka Streams and Consumers to read events created at customer site to monitor progress and productivity.
    - Work very closely with architect and infrastructure team to ensure new Kafka cluster and event infrastructure is ready for production by providing constructive feedback from downstream consumer's point of view.
    - Work with product team to model behavior of the events generated from the producing application into several state transition diagrams to be used in **Vertica** data warehouse.
    - Applied prior working knowledge with bitsets and bitwise logic as an embedded systems engineer to speed up rule matching behavior to take only .05 percent of original time.
