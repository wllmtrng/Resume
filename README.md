Senior Software Engineer (Oct 2016 - Dec 2017)   

* Managerial Responsibilities
    - Lead Risk Analytics team in designing and building out an API to allow physicians to automatically get a list of probable diagnoses for a given patient, given past billing history and clinical notes, by providing a queryable **GraphQL** interface to serve dataset generated through periodically running jobs on **AWS EMR** [**Apache Spark**, **Node.js, PostgreSQL**].
    - Guide senior software engineer to utilize **AWS Redshift** as a data warehouse to store click-based events for the purposes of reporting and serving KPI dashboards.
    - Strategize with product team to prioritize product roadmap, juggling between maintaining existing product line and implementing new functional requirements.
    - Interview candidates for junior and senior software engineer positions and hire based on growth potential, technical ability, and cultural fit.
    - Mentor software engineers by pair programming, reviewing work, providing feedback, and guiding them to find the right solution for a given problem. 
* Technical Duties
    - Build HIPAA compliant multi-tenanted RESTful web services under the **Spring Framework** to assist health insurance plans to improve their risk adjustment performance analyzing administrative and clinical patient data through batch processing to find gaps in care for the patient and identify patient risk for the insurance plan, which is communicated through KPI dashboards, maps, graphs, and reports. **[Java, JDBC, MySQL, Scala, Apache Spark, Kafka, S3, EMR, CloudFormation]**
* Highlights
    - As an individual contributor, spearheaded effort and educated stakeholders to transition existing data aggregation and batch processing pipeline under **Java, JDBC, and MySQL** to a more performant, scalable, and distributed approach with
    **Scala** and **Apache Spark** to decrease costs and address business need of generating larger reports under a shorter amount of time.
    - Exposed team to a developmental workflow using **Jupyter Notebook** to rapidly prototype out the existing batch processing pipeline to serve as a proof of concept, showing potential to scale as well as having 56x performance gains for 100-gigabyte scale datasets.
    - Took initial ownership of involvement to integrate Risk Analytics platform with **Apache Kafka** event infrastructure to consume real-time events.
    - Work very closely with architect and infrastructure team to ensure new Kafka cluster and event infrastructure is ready for production by providing constructive feedback from downstream consumer's point of view.
    - Work with product team to model the user click events into several state transition diagrams to be used inside a **Redshift** data warehouse.
    - Applied prior working knowledge with bitsets and bitwise logic as an embedded systems engineer to speed up rule matching behavior to take only .05 percent of the original time.
