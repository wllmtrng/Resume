**Scala and Apache Spark** to decrease costs and address business need of delivering ability to generate larger 
reports under a shorter amount of time
    - Exposed to team a developmental workflow for rapidly prototyping batch processing functionality to serve as a proof
    of concept to upper management, showing potential to scale as well as having 56x performance gains for gigabyte scale 
    datasets
    - Applied prior working knowledge with bitsets and bitwise logic as an embedded systems engineer to notion of 
    compound membership to speed up rule matching aggregation behavior to take only .05 percent of original time.
* Took initial ownership of involvement to integrate Risk Analytics platform with new event infrastructure to consume real
time events [**Kafka**]
    - Work very closely with architect and infrastructure team to ensure new Kafka cluster and event infrastructure is ready
    for production by providing constructive feedback from downstream consumer's point of view.
